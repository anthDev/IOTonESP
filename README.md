# IOTonESP ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘
A simple IoT adaptation package for ESP8266 on a shield with different sensors. 
Coded in C++ on Arduino IDE. It is important to have the SPIFF extension and the NodeMCU 1.0 compiler (for ESP). 
An Arduino project is in progress but I don't know if I would publish it. 
It's based from University Project - France Campus La Garde, UniversitÃ© de Toulon Â®
